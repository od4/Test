	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<p> 
A project to explore the population of electric vehicles registered within Washington state and visualize locational differences across states and how electric vehicle features are distributed among these geographic areas, including the vehicle range, clean alternative fuel vehicle eligibility, and electric vehicle type. After modeling the representation of electric cars in Washington, the goal is to gain conclusions through visualization methods relating to environmental impacts and eligibility or lack thereof to have such an effect.

			<h3>Average Range By State</h3>
			<p>      
The following plot looks into the average electric range of vehicles based on the state in which they were geographically found for our sample of Washington's electric cars. The distribution of electric car features is further broken down in detail from hovering over the state on the electric range plot. Here, it shows distribution of model years, in comparison to the average range on one refuel. Additionally, the distribution of cars that are plug-in hybrid versus battery electric vehicles is shown through the coloring, and eligibility for a clean alternative fuel credential is represented by the point's shape.

            <h3>Takeaways For Range</h3>
            <p> 
                
                         Some of the states within the continental United States did not have any representation among cars registered to the state of Washington. There was a wide range regarding the electric ranges due to the variation of electric vehicle type. While hybrid cars can go several hundred miles on one tank of gas, only a two digit value can be attributed to solely electric energy. Therefore, the distribution across states is wide because some states did not have a lot of representation among cars registered to Washington state, and the few contained in the sample for these states happened to be hybrid cars. While Delaware had the highest average electric range, it only had one car that was found to be registered to Washington. Therefore, to say it maximizes environmental impact across the entire country would be misleading. Looking into other leading contenders showed similar findings. States such as Wisconsin, Tennessee, Alabama, and Wyoming had average electric ranges in the 300's but again, there were only a few cars per state. Washington, California and Texas however, had higher representation among cars found to be registered in Washington despite their average range being lower and around 200 miles. Even though their average range is lower, they have a greater environmental impact because the benefits are administered through more citizens rather than just one or two car owners.

            <h3>Is There a Better Way To Account For The Variation In State Representation?</h3>
            <p> 
                
                As mentioned above, looking at the average electric range by state can be misleading due to mere quantity of data points represented. A state that has a few battery electric vehicles, such as Idaho, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Alabama, New Hampshire, and Delaware, appear to have a greater environmental impact compared to a state that has many more cars registered to Washington state but happens to have a more even distribution of plug in hybrid cars and battery electric cars.

            
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Investigating the number of cars rather than the specific electric range, may give a better indication of an overall level of sustainability. That being said, looking at the count distribution across states would run into similar conclusions regarding the potential to mislead viewers. The data shows cars registered through Washington, so Washington state would naturally have more cars within the dataset. Therefore, when analyzing mere counts, we investigated Washington state specifically at a more granular level in terms of the county.

            <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
            <p> 
                
                Overall, every car on the road that is utilizing clean energy sources is a step in the right direction regarding environmental impacts. There is an economic aspect to such trends in terms of being financially stable enough to afford more expensive, but environmentally friendly cars. Visualizing such trends indicates the importance of having a prosocial desire to make change as well as the financial backing to support such efforts.

                The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">Electric Vehicle Type</abbr> refers to the car being a hybrid or plug in electric vehicle. Hybrid cars typically run on electric up until their battery is depleated and revert to gas power following, taking a break from electrical use to recharge the battery. Plug in electric vehicles refer to cars that are completely reliant on battery usage.

				<h3 class="archives">Data Cleaning Measures</h3>
				For data values with an electric range listed as 0 miles, we manually researched the make, model, and year to update with proper values. The data had several missing values in the variables for legislative district, location of the vehicle, and base MSRP. We are not concerned with a specificity of location beyond the state level so do not want any further level of granularity. Furthermore, the MSRP is a measure for vehicle luxury, but our analysis focuses on the environmental impacts through the cars range rather than cost of such cars. Therefore, to clean up these missing values, we will simply get rid of these columns, as our analysis is not reliant on such values.

                    Notes on Feature Distribution 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Looking at the overview of Washington's scaterplot, it becomes evident that plug in hybrid cars tend to have lower electric ranges compared to battery electric vehicles. Many of these hybrid cars are not elegible for a distinction of clean alternative fuel elegibility. The range of hybrid capabilities did not seem to increase over time significantly, but the capacity of battery electric vehicles did progress exponentially from early data points in 2002 compared to present day car in 2023. Additionally, while many battery electric vehicles are elegible for the certification in models predating 2020/2021, the newer models elegibility is still unknown. This seems to indicate that studies have not been completed on the newer cars. Based on the past trends, it is probable they will meet the standard and become clean alternative fuel elegible after the study is conducted.

                    The base color scale of the plot indicates the income levels of Washington state counties while the blue dots located on each county represent the count of electric cars found within that county. This visualization clearly indicates that King County not only houses the highest income level out of all the counties, but also drastically outweighs all the other counties in terms of the number of electric vehicles found there. The light blue color found on most of the dots indicate a widespread range of values that are overshadowed by the outlying value in King County.  However, this was done purposefully to maximally depict the enormity in number of electric cars found in King County over all the others. This drastic change indicates a relationship between the wealth of the county and the number of electric vehicles owned within it.
